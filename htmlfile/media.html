        <p>Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.</p>
        <hr  >    
        <h4 style="color: blue;">What is Multimedia?</h4>
        <p>Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can 
        hear or see, like images, music, 
        sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.</p>
        <p>Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Browser Support</h2>
        <p>The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.</p>
        <p>Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia!</p>
        <hr><h2>Multimedia Formats</h2>
        <p>Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. </p>
        <p>The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file 
        extension.</p>
        <p>Multimedia files have formats and different extensions 
        like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.</p>
